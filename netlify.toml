# If you need API routes, you'll need to use Netlify Functions
# For now, this configuration will serve the static frontend
# Note: Netlify doesn't support full Express servers directly
# You may need to:
# 1. Deploy the frontend to Netlify (this config)
# 2. Deploy the backend separately to a Node.js hosting service (Railway, Render, etc.)
# 3. Or convert API routes to Netlify Functions
